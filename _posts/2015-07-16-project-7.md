### blacklivesmatter Preliminary Analysis
Chris E. Rees  

Over the weekend I used Twitter's API to grab a sample of 50,000 #blacklivesmatter tweets from the previous week. With some clever data manipulation and statistical knowhow the data can be used to explore user, network, and content patterns to gain a better understanding about who the key figures are in the social media movement and the type of messages their content includes. A subsample (N=200) of the data is provided below to show a glimpse at some of information the API provides.

# User Analysis

For a first glance at this data we might be interested in knowing who is using the hastag and how much they use it. The first chart reveals the most active #blacklivesmatters tweeters, while the second chart depicts the highest leverage tweeters as measued by the ratio of retweets to tweets.  Not suprisingly this second graph shows the dominance of media outlets (e.g. The Root, CBS News, Face the Nation).

# Social Network Analysis

We might also want to view the connections between tweeters.  For instance we might be interested in if a hastag is generating conversations between people or whether certain tweeters are able to disseminate there content outside there local network (egohood).  The graph below provides a snapshot of the #blacklivematter tweeter network.  I subsetted the sample to 250 random cases for simplicity, however, networks are more apparent when larger samples are used.  The graph maps the node's color to whether the tweeter was a standard user or verified user and maps the node's size to the relative number of retweets their tweet generated.  To navigate the graph you can scroll to zoom, click and drag whitespace to pan, and click and drag nodes to fling them around.

# Text Mining and Analysis

## Word Frequency and Wordclouds

Arguably the most important information that can be generated in hashtag analysis is the content itself.  This type of analysis focuses on the question: What themes are developing around the hashtag?  A general overview can be created by counting the frequency of word usage, while excluding common words such as "it", "the", "for", etc.  This basic overview can then be visualized in a wordcloud.  The color and size of the word are being mapped to the frequency of its usage.

## Word Cooccurrence and Higher Order Associations
We might also be interested in looking past singular words and instead examine the cooccurrence of words and word stems or even higher-order levels of association.  For example we may want to know what words cooccur or correlate with the word "police".  We can first generate a table of cooccuring words based on a minimum correlation threshold (corr=.25), and then graph the relationship between those words to get a sense of what topics are forming.  Only one example ('police') is provided here, but we could easily iterate this process through other high usage words to get a sense of the topics that are developing around #blacklivesmatter.

## Text Sentiment

Finally beyond just the topics of content we may be interested in the meaning of that contnet. For instance, we might be interested in whether there is postive or negative seniment around a hastag.  Using dictionaries of words based on linguistic research we can measure the polarity of a tweet.  We could either focus on global sentiment around a hashtag or focus more specifically on tweets containg certain words such as 'police'.

We could also focus on less discrete measures of sentiment such as emotion.  Again by creating dictionaries based on existing research we can estimate global or word specific sentiment within our tweet sample.
